.:: Usage Notes
1. Get root on a console
2. Source the init_env script to setup CPUFreq and a testing SandBox
3. Start the monitor tool and use the generated console to run your tests
4. Ensure the console is running in the root CGroup partition
   i.e. cat /proc/self/cgroup sould return "/" as cgroup
   To move the console in the root group:
   echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/tasks
5. Start each test as a RT task at prio level 12, e.g.
   chrt -f 12 ./trace_compare.sh

NOTE: all tests must be started by the monitor console, which is configure to run as a RT task,
otherwise you could experience poor system responsiveness
